12345678	Numbers only	15%	< 1 second	Very weak and commonly used

✅ Tips Learned from Evaluation
Length matters: The longer the password, the harder it is to crack.

Avoid common patterns: Passwords like "password123" or "123456" are extremely vulnerable.

Use complexity: Combine uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and numbers.

Avoid dictionary words: Attackers use dictionary attacks to crack passwords.

Use passphrases: Long, memorable phrases like "Il0ve!IceCream@Night" are strong and easy to remember.

Don’t reuse passwords: Each account should have a unique password.

🛡️ Common Password Attacks
Attack Type	Description
Brute Force	Tries every possible combination until it finds the correct one. Slower but effective against short/simple passwords.
Dictionary Attack	Uses a list of common words or passwords to guess. Fast and effective against simple and common passwords.
Credential Stuffing	Uses leaked username/password pairs to try logging into other accounts.
Social Engineering	Tricks users into revealing passwords. Not technical, but very effective.

🔐 How Password Complexity Affects Security
Higher complexity (length, symbols, randomness) = exponentially longer time to crack.

Predictable patterns or short lengths = easily crackable even by simple tools.

Passphrases that mix character types and have enough length strike the best balance between usability and security.

📌 Conclusion
A strong password is:

Long (at least 12–16 characters),

Complex (mix of upper/lower case, numbers, symbols),

Unique (used only once per site),

Unpredictable (not based on dictionary words or patterns).

Use password managers to help generate and store secure passwords without memorizing them all.
